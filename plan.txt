lets go one by one, so the flow is 
1. provide domain
2. select either upload phishing website files or evilginx setup.
3. if Generic phishing setup is selected then we do normal setup where we unzip the files and send to /var/www/html 
4. If evilginx is selected, then we do evilginx setup.
5. Provide Lure URL and watch for credentials either its from evilginx or generic phishing setup.

flow is completed
